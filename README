The goal of this program is to download subtitle files for Tv shows, rename them and move them to their proper locations.
It is written in an object oriented style that should lend to easy modification for other file sorting tasks

This program makes a number of assumptions:
1. The tv shows are stored into separate directories under one directory.
2. The directories are named for what they store (offthemap holds the show 'off the map')
3. Tv shows have their season and episode number in their filename in either of the following formats: s##e## or ##x## (new formats can be added in TvSeasonEpisodeCriterion.__init__() )
4. the subtitle files are stored in a specific directory (indicated in head.py)
5. 2011-3-31: You are using Windows (Repository._highscore() makes this assumption and can be easily edited) (this assumption will be elimininated)


Current State: 2011-3-31
The program can be run by executing head.py
The names of the subtitle and tv repositories are named in head.py
No download functionality
